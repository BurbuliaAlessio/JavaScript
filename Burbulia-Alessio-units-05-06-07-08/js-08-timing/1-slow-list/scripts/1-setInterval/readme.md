file: 1-setInterval
author: Burbulia Alessio


## Problem Description
- Create an array that holds a list of 30 items (food, books, etc.).
- Print one item of the list every second until the list is completely printed.
  - Use `setInterval` to achieve this goal.
  - Do the same thing using `setTimeout`.

## Approach to the Solution
To solve this problem, we can use JavaScript's `setInterval` and `setTimeout` functions to print each element of the array at one-second intervals.
