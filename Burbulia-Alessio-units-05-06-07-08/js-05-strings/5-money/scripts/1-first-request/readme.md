## request of exercise

5 Money
 Create a function called Money
 It should take a single argument, an amount, and return 'amount dollars'
 Add a smiley at the end if the amount is 1 million. Deal with edge cases

 For example

 Money(1): 10 dollar;
 Money(10): 10 dollars;
 Money(1000000): 1000000 dollars;
 Bonus add to the function the ability to convert dollars to euros Money(10): 10 dollars are 9.31 euros

Function Definition: I'll create a function named money that takes a single argument, an amount.
Returning the Amount: Inside the function, I'll check if the input is a number and greater than or equal to zero. If so, I'll return the amount string in dollars. If the amount is exactly 1 million, I'll add a smiley at the end of the string.
Handling Edge Cases: If the input is invalid (not a number or negative), I'll return an error message.
