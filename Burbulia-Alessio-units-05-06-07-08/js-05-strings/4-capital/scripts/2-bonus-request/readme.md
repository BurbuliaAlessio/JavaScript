## request of exercise

     ● Write a JavaScript function called capital which has one parameter, a string, and which returns
     that string with the first letter capitalized
     ● For example, the call toLowerCase()("hello world") should return the string "Hello world"

     Bonus
     Modify the function so that it capitalizes each word. capital2("my name is john") 
     should return the string "My Name Is John"

## on javascript

1. **Function Definition:** I've created a function called `capital` which takes one parameter, `s`, representing the string to capitalize each word.
2. **Capitalizing Each Word:** Within the function, I've used the `replace` method to iterate over each word in the string and replace each word with its uppercase version.
3. **Returning the Capitalized String:** The function returns the string with each word capitalized.
