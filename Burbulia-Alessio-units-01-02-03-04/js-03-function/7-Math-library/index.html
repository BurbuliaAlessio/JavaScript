    ● Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument <br>
    (a number), square that number, and return the result. <br>
    It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."<br>
    ● Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number),<br>
    divide it by 2, and return the result.<br>
    It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5."<br>
    ● Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out <br>
    what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return <br>
    the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4." <br>
    ● Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the  <br>
    radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also  <br>
    log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is  <br>
    12.566370614359172." <br>
    ● Bonus: round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal
