    <h1>Calculate-age</h1>
    <p>
      ● Store your birth year in a variable.<br>
      ● Store a future year in a variable.<br>
      ● Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.<br>
      ● For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what <br>
      month it is in 2026.<br>
      ● Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.
